## Usage

The application allows employees to view their schedules, release shifts for pickup by other employees, pick up released shifts, and request specific shifts from other employees. 

### Schedule View

- The home screen displays the current month and year.
- A week selector component allows users to select the weeks displayed in the weekly schedule component.
- The weekly schedule component displays details about the user's schedule for the week selected by the week selector.

### Shift Release

- Employees can release shifts they are assigned and do not want to work. This action tells other employees that the shift is available for "pick up".
- An employee retains the released shift until another employee picks up that shift.

### Shift Pick Up

- Employees can pick up released shifts.

### Shift Request

- Employees can request to pick up a specific shift from another employee, regardless of whether that shift has been released or not.
- The request a pick up component will render a list of all employees working on that date at that shift time and what section each is scheduled for and a TouchableOpacity that will send a pick-up request to that user.
