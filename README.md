## Usage

StoneSchedules allows employees to:

- View their assigned shifts, including the date, time, and section.
- Release shifts they don't want to work, making them available for other employees to pick up.
- Request to pick up shifts from other employees, either by sending a pickup request or by picking up a released shift.

To release a shift:

1. Click on the shift you want to release.
2. Click the "Release Shift" button.
3. Confirm that you want to release the shift.

To pick up a released shift:

1. Click on the released shift you want to pick up.
2. Click the "Pick Up Shift" button.
3. Confirm that you want to pick up the shift.

To request to pick up a shift:

1. Click on the employee whose shift you want to pick up.
2. Click the "Request to Pick Up Shift" button.
3. Wait for the owner of the shift to accept or deny your request.

### Schedule View

- The home screen displays the current month and year.
- A week selector component allows users to select the weeks displayed in the weekly schedule component.
- The weekly schedule component displays details about the user's schedule for the week selected by the week selector.

### Shift Release

- Employees can release shifts they are assigned and do not want to work. This action tells other employees that the shift is available for "pick up".
- An employee retains the released shift until another employee picks up that shift.

### Shift Pick Up

- Employees can pick up released shifts.

### Shift Request

- Employees can request to pick up a specific shift from another employee, regardless of whether that shift has been released or not.
- The request a pick up component will render a list of all employees working on that date at that shift time and what section each is scheduled for and a TouchableOpacity that will send a pick-up request to that user.
