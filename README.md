Usage
To launch StoneSchedules, navigate to the project's root directory and run `npm start`. This will launch the Expo Developer Tools in your browser. You can then run the app on your local device using the Expo Client app or on an emulator.

Once the app is running, users can view their schedules for a given week using the week selector component.

Other employees can then request to pick up released shifts or to pick up a specific shift from another employee.

Features
View schedules for a given week
The main feature of StoneSchedules is the ability for users to view their schedules for a given week. The week selector component allows users to select the week they want to view, and the weekly schedule component displays their shifts for that week.

Release shifts that cannot be worked
If a user is unable to work a shift, they can release the shift for other employees to pick up. To release a shift, the user can tap on the shift they want to release and select "Release Shift".

Request to pick up released shifts or specific shifts from other employees
If a shift has been released, other employees can request to pick up the shift. To request a shift, the user can tap on the released shift and select "Request Shift". Users can also request to pick up a specific shift from another employee. To do so, the user can use the request a pick up component to send a pick up request to the employee who is scheduled for the shift.
